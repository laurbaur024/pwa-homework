# PWA Text Editor Homework

## Activity

- For this activity I added PWA functionality to the JATE (Just Another Text Editor) application.

## User Instructions

- This is a PWA (Progressive Web App) Text Editor. 
- You may use this as a normal text editor or install the application locally and use it in offline mode.
- Your data will be stored in offline mode and reconnected when you are online again.
